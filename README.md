# Portfolio-Project-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP
Code Academy Data Science Path Portfolio Project Life Expectancy and GDP of Data Visualization


## Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between the economic output of a country (GDP) and the life expectancy of its citizens. Using data from the World Health Organization and the World Bank, we will analyze, prepare, and plot data to identify trends and correlations.


## Project Objectives

1. Import and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize data using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
3. Analyze the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
4. Summarize findings and share insights in a blog post.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a solid understanding of the following topic:

- Python Fundamentals
- Data Acquisition
- Data Visualization
- Hypothesis Testing
- Summarizing Quantitative Data
- Data Wrangling and Tidying
- Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with analysis description, code, and visualizations.
- all_data.csv: CSV file containing GDP and life expectancy data used in the analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:shahira-sadat/Portfolio-Project-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Portfolio-Project-GDP-and-Life-Expectancy

   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

   ```

4. **Start exploring the OKCupid_Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook:**

   ```bash
   life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb
   ```

## Overview

The script does the following:

1. Loading Data:

   - Imports the CSV file into a DataFrame and inspects the data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Cleans and preprocesses the data.
   - Visualizes the distribution of GDP and life expectancy.
   - Calculates and visualizes average GDP and life expectancy by country.

3. Analysis:

   - Analyzes trends over time and the correlation between GDP and life expectancy.

4. Summary and Insights:
   - Summarizes findings and provides insights on the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.


Feel free to modify and extend the script according to your needs.
